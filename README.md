### The Project

This app was intended to be an app to demo the travelling salesman problem and some algorithm/heuristics that try to solve it.

### Currently

Currently the app is only an example/test to learn how Sigma (the js library for the graphs) works. The app allows you to specify a graph node-by-node and edge-by-edge using the form on the left, or toggle the form with the button at the top to copy/paste a whole graph in (JSON format).
